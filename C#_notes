#*This is some random Cshar notes. Lets see where we got*#
Lil off key:
#you can use the commmand line csc(Free Enterprise) program.cs to run 
#or dotnet run.

This is basically C:
	it got header file:
		"using" is a header file. it calls for da system."System" 
namespaces provide a heirarchical means of organization.:
	They can contain other namespaces and types
#low key name spaces are just header files. Wonder what other kind they got
#*
Console refers to the program(System.Program(Console).WriteLine("Makes so much more sense"))
*#
	when "using","namespace", namespaces can allow for the use of shorthands:
		System.Console.WriteLine, can be used as Console.WriteLine

You can really just type#*print(Hello Wrld), this is why pie the best OOL*#, you gotta class it.:
	#like in Hello{} in ellowrld.cs
	It has a method, "static void method", now its static#*I dont think it take arguments*# and its I dont know wat void mean
#TECH: if I got it right, you can call(refer) to method(Hello{}) with "this"
